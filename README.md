Based on data from BPS (Badan Pusat Statistik) in 2020, there are around 29% of individuals who have hearing difficulties and 16,5 %  have communication difficulties in indonesia. Therefore, SiBisa, our innovative sign language translator application, aims to address this issue. SiBisa enables effective communication between mute and deaf individuals and the wider community. This application aims to bridge the gap by providing real-time translation of sign language of  BISINDO (Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia) into text. This will empower mute and deaf individuals to express themselves freely, engage in meaningful conversations, and access information and services that would otherwise be challenging to obtain. There is also a learning feature for users who want to learn sign language.
